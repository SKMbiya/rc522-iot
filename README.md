rc522-iot
=========

A python wrapper API that allows you to interface with the mfrc522 RFID card reader and a Raspberry Pi Zero W

Requirements
--------
This code requires you to have the mfrc522 and RPi.GPIO libraries installed. They can be installed using the following commands respectively ``sudo pip3 install mfrc522`` and ``pip install RPi.GPIO``. It is also recommended that you make use of a python virtual environment before installing the libraries, by making use of tools such as venv or virtualenv.

Features
--------

This API provides you with functions allowing you to:
* Enable/disable SPI communication between the Raspberry Pi and the RFID card reader
* Reset RFID cards and tags by clearing the text stored in them
* Read the text and id number associated to RFID cards and tags
* Write text to RFID cards and tags
